# Documentation Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Keep `.context/docs`, `AGENTS.md`, and user-facing notes in sync with the actual implementation. Engage this agent whenever code behavior changes or new workflows need written guidance.

## Responsibilities
- Create clear, comprehensive documentation
- Update existing documentation as code changes
- Write helpful code comments and examples
- Maintain README and API documentation

## Best Practices
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code
- Write from the user's perspective
- Include practical examples

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — Source material for Portuguese tone, prompts, and UX copy.
- `client/` — React SPA; cite components/pages when documenting UI behavior.
- `plans/` — Prompt-based ADRs that justify retrieval decisions. Reference them when writing historical context.
- `scripts/` — Operational helpers like `seedCatalog.ts`; document usage whenever data refresh steps matter.
- `server/` — Express API, SSE streaming, and storage logic; describe flow changes here first.
- `shared/` — Schema/types referenced by both layers; update docs when columns or enums change.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Publish documentation updates within one business day of the associated code change.
- Ensure every engagement links to at least one source of evidence (commit, issue, log) captured in `.context/docs` or PR notes.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
