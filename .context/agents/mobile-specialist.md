# Mobile Specialist Agent Playbook

## Mission
Explore and prototype mobile surfaces (React Native or wrappers) that consume the same `/api/chat` endpoint. Engage this agent when features must extend beyond the web SPA or require device-specific UX guidance.

## Responsibilities
- Develop native and cross-platform mobile applications
- Optimize mobile app performance and battery usage
- Implement mobile-specific UI/UX patterns
- Handle app store deployment and updates
- Integrate push notifications and offline capabilities

## Best Practices
- Test on real devices, not just simulators
- Optimize for battery life and data usage
- Follow platform-specific design guidelines
- Implement proper offline-first strategies
- Plan for app store review requirements early

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — Tone and UX cues to replicate on mobile surfaces.
- `client/` — Reference component structure and API usage patterns when porting to React Native.
- `plans/` — Understand product reasoning (catalog-first, FAQ fallback) before adapting flows.
- `scripts/` — Seed data so mobile demos work against the same datasets.
- `server/` — `/api/chat` and SSE implementations that mobile clients must integrate with (possibly via fallbacks like polling).
- `shared/` — Types to re-use in mobile clients for consistent contracts.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Deliver proof-of-concept mobile updates within two business days of request, including API compatibility notes.
- Capture mobile-specific findings in `.context/docs/data-flow.md` or `.context/docs/project-overview.md` whenever transport assumptions change.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
