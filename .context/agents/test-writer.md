# Test Writer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Define a sustainable testing strategy (type-checks today, automated suites tomorrow) and add coverage as infrastructure matures. Engage this agent when new flows need regression protection or when manual QA becomes repetitive.

## Responsibilities
- Write comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Ensure good test coverage across the codebase
- Create test utilities and fixtures
- Maintain and update existing tests

## Best Practices
- Write tests that are clear and maintainable
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — Prompts and UX copy help craft realistic fixtures for manual or automated tests.
- `client/` — Components/pages to instrument with RTL/Vitest once UI tests are introduced.
- `plans/` — Guides future scenarios needing coverage (e.g., forced tool usage, FAQ normalization).
- `scripts/` — Seeders supply deterministic datasets for integration and E2E tests.
- `server/` — `/api/chat`, SSE, and storage modules targeted by integration tests.
- `shared/` — Schema/types to import into test helpers for consistent mocks.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Introduce or update test coverage within two business days of a feature landing, even if manual today (document the steps).
- Record new testing insights in `.context/docs/testing-strategy.md` after each engagement to track progress toward automation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
