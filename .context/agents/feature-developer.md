# Feature Developer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Ship end-to-end features that span the React SPA, Express API, and Postgres storage. Engage this agent when roadmap items require coordinated client/server work.

## Responsibilities
- Implement new features according to specifications
- Design clean, maintainable code architecture
- Integrate features with existing codebase
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

## Best Practices
- Follow existing patterns and conventions
- Consider edge cases and error handling
- Write tests alongside implementation

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — Design copy, prompt transcripts, and UX cues to follow when adding UI surface area.
- `client/` — Components, hooks, and pages where most feature work starts.
- `plans/` — ADR-like docs capturing why retrieval works the way it does; consult before diverging.
- `scripts/` — CLI aids for seeding or migrations you might extend when features require new data.
- `server/` — `/api/chat` logic, OpenRouter orchestration, SSE infrastructure, and storage adapters.
- `shared/` — Schema/types to update when features introduce new fields or enums.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Deliver scoped feature increments within two business days of kickoff, including manual test notes and screenshots.
- Update `.context/docs/project-overview.md` or related guides whenever a feature changes workflows or dependencies.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
