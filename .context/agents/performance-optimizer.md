# Performance Optimizer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Profile the chat experience end-to-end, remove latency hotspots, and keep bundle and query performance within acceptable targets. Engage this agent when response times regress or infrastructure costs need trimming.

## Responsibilities
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize code for speed and efficiency
- Implement caching strategies
- Monitor and improve resource usage

## Best Practices
- Measure before optimizing
- Focus on actual bottlenecks
- Don't sacrifice readability unnecessarily

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — UX references describing acceptable latency cues shown to users.
- `client/` — Inspect React components, React Query configs, and bundle size impacts.
- `plans/` — Understand trade-offs made during previous retrieval improvements before refactoring them.
- `scripts/` — Use seeds to create realistic datasets for profiling.
- `server/` — Evaluate middleware overhead, OpenRouter call sequencing, and Drizzle queries.
- `shared/` — Schema definitions; adjust indexes or constraints here when optimizing DB access.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Cut identified latency regressions within two business days, sharing before/after numbers in the PR.
- Document optimizations in `.context/docs/architecture.md` or `.context/docs/data-flow.md` so future work builds on accurate baselines.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
