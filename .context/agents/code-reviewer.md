# Code Reviewer Agent Playbook

## Mission
Safeguard quality by reviewing pull requests for correctness, style, and documentation alignment. Engage this agent before merging any non-trivial change.

## Responsibilities
- Review code changes for quality, style, and best practices
- Identify potential bugs and security issues
- Ensure code follows project conventions
- Provide constructive feedback and suggestions

## Best Practices
- Focus on maintainability and readability
- Consider the broader impact of changes
- Be constructive and specific in feedback

## Key Project Resources
- Documentation index: [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md)
- Agent handbook: [agents/README.md](./README.md)
- Agent knowledge base: [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)
- Contributor guide: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Repository Starting Points
- `attached_assets/` — Context for UX copy or prompt tone; reference when checking text changes.
- `client/` — React components, hooks, and Tailwind styles to review for accessibility and state handling.
- `plans/` — Historical decisions to cite when assessing architectural consistency.
- `scripts/` — Helper utilities that PRs might touch (e.g., new seeds or migrations).
- `server/` — Express logic, OpenRouter integration, and storage modules that require careful scrutiny.
- `shared/` — Schema and type definitions—ensure updates include migrations and doc references.

## Collaboration Checklist
1. Confirm assumptions with issue reporters or maintainers.
2. Review open pull requests affecting this area.
3. Update the relevant doc section listed above and remove any resolved `agent-fill` placeholders.
4. Capture learnings back in [docs/README.md](../docs/README.md) or the appropriate task marker.

## Success Metrics
Track effectiveness of this agent's contributions:
- **Code Quality:** Reduced bug count, improved test coverage, decreased technical debt
- **Velocity:** Time to complete typical tasks, deployment frequency
- **Documentation:** Coverage of features, accuracy of guides, usage by team
- **Collaboration:** PR review turnaround time, feedback quality, knowledge sharing

**Target Metrics:**
- Provide review feedback within one business day of assignment to keep release velocity high.
- Ensure every reviewed PR references the relevant `.context/docs` section or gets updated accordingly before approval.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues
Document frequent problems this agent encounters and their solutions:

### Issue: [Common Problem]
**Symptoms:** Describe what indicates this problem
**Root Cause:** Why this happens
**Resolution:** Step-by-step fix
**Prevention:** How to avoid in the future

**Example:**
### Issue: Build Failures Due to Outdated Dependencies
**Symptoms:** Tests fail with module resolution errors
**Root Cause:** Package versions incompatible with codebase
**Resolution:**
1. Review package.json for version ranges
2. Run `npm update` to get compatible versions
3. Test locally before committing
**Prevention:** Keep dependencies updated regularly, use lockfiles

## Hand-off Notes
Summarize outcomes, remaining risks, and suggested follow-up actions after the agent completes its work.

## Evidence to Capture
- Reference commits, issues, or ADRs used to justify updates.
- Command output or logs that informed recommendations.
- Follow-up items for maintainers or future agent runs.
- Performance metrics and benchmarks where applicable.
